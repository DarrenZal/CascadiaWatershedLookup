## Current Priority: Phase 2 - Data Pipeline Creation

**Next Session Focus:**
1. Download and process watershed datasets
2. Create unified `cascadia_watersheds.gpkg` file
3. Test with real watershed lookups
4. Validate data coverage and accuracy

**Commands to remember:**
```bash
# Activate environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Run application
python app.py

# Test API
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/lookup -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"address": "123 Main St, Seattle, WA"}'
```
